MediaUI is designed to be straightforward. The main structure is typically composed of a header, a main content area with panels, and a footer.

Here is a basic example of an HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My App with MediaUI</title>
    <!-- Link to MediaUI's CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header class="main-header"><!-- Header content --></header>

    <main class="main-content">
        <div class="panel left-panel"><!-- File tree or other navigation --></div>
        <div class="panel main-panel">
            <div class="tabs"><!-- Tab items --></div>
            <div class="editor-content"><!-- Main content --></div>
            <div class="terminal"><!-- Terminal component --></div>
        </div>
