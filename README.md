## Getting Started

To get started with FileUI, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FileUI.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd FileUI

# Open index.html in your default browser
# On macOS:
open index.html
# On Windows:
start index.html
# On Linux:

## Usage

FileUI is designed to be straightforward. The main structure is typically composed of a header, a main content area with panels, and a footer.

Here is a basic example of an HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My App with FileUI</title>
    <!-- Link to FileUI's CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header class="main-header"><!-- Header content --></header>

    <main class="main-content">
        <div class="panel left-panel"><!-- File tree or other navigation --></div>
        <div class="panel main-panel">
            <div class="tabs"><!-- Tab items --></div>
            <div class="editor-content"><!-- Main content --></div>
            <div class="terminal"><!-- Terminal component --></div>
        </div>
    </main>

    <footer class="main-footer"><!-- Footer content like status bar --></footer>

    <!-- Link to FileUI's JavaScript -->
    <script src="js/main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
*Note: The class names and structure above are illustrative. Please refer to the source code for the actual implementation.*

## Components

FileUI comes with a variety of ready-to-use components built with Vanilla JS:

-   **Resizable Panels:** Draggable splitter for flexible side-by-side layouts.
-   **Split Panels:** Create vertical or horizontal splits within the editor area for multi-pane layouts.
-   **Tabbed Interface:** A standard tabbing system for managing different views.
-   **Interactive Terminal:** A simulated terminal that processes basic commands.
-   **Modal Dialogs:** An accessible modal component for focused user interaction.
-   **Headers & Footers:** Customizable top and bottom bars.
-   **File Tree:** A collapsible tree view for navigating files and folders.
-   **UI Controls:** A set of pre-styled buttons and inputs.

## Customization & Theming

Customizing the look and feel is simple thanks to CSS Custom Properties (Variables). You can find and override the default theme variables in the main CSS file (e.g., `css/style.css`).
