# FileUI Style Guide Modernization Tasks

## CURRENT TASK: UI Component Pattern Modernization

### Objective
Modernize the FileUI style guide components to follow best modern standards while preserving the existing design system.

### Analysis Summary
After analyzing the current implementation in `/home/danger/Documents/GitHub/FileUI/docs/style/`, the codebase shows good foundations with CSS custom properties, clean component patterns, and modular architecture. However, there are opportunities to modernize the component patterns to match current industry standards.

### Todo Items

#### Phase 1: Web Components Architecture (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [x] Create base Web Component class for FileUI components
- [x] Convert button component to `<fileui-button>` custom element
- [x] Convert modal component to `<fileui-modal>` custom element
- [x] Convert toast component to `<fileui-toast>` custom element
- [x] Implement Shadow DOM for style encapsulation
- [x] Add proper lifecycle methods (connectedCallback, disconnectedCallback)
- [x] Create custom events for component interactions
- [ ] Update index.html to use new custom elements
- [x] Create web-components-demo.html showcase
- [x] Add FileUI global helper for backward compatibility

#### Phase 2: TypeScript Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Set up TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Convert styles.js to styles.ts
- [ ] Add interfaces for all component options
- [ ] Add type definitions for component props
- [ ] Create type-safe event handlers
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments with type information
- [ ] Set up build process for TypeScript compilation

#### Phase 3: Enhanced Accessibility (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Add comprehensive ARIA attributes to all components
- [ ] Implement focus management system
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- [ ] Create screen reader announcements for dynamic content
- [ ] Implement focus trap for modals
- [ ] Add skip links and landmarks
- [ ] Test with screen readers

#### Phase 4: Reactive State Management (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Implement reactive data binding using Proxy pattern
- [ ] Create observable state store
- [ ] Add computed properties support
- [ ] Implement watchers for state changes
- [ ] Create event bus for component communication
- [ ] Add two-way data binding for form elements
- [ ] Create state management examples

#### Phase 5: Developer Experience (LOW PRIORITY)
- [ ] Create comprehensive component documentation
- [ ] Set up Storybook for component showcase
- [ ] Add interactive component playground
- [ ] Export design tokens in multiple formats
- [ ] Create code snippets and examples
- [ ] Add component API documentation
- [ ] Create migration guide from current version

#### Phase 6: Testing Infrastructure (LOW PRIORITY)
- [ ] Set up Jest/Vitest for unit testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for all components
- [ ] Set up Playwright for E2E testing
- [ ] Add visual regression tests
- [ ] Integrate axe-core for accessibility testing
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline for tests

### Implementation Strategy
1. Start with Phase 1 to establish the Web Components foundation
2. Maintain backward compatibility with current API
3. Keep the existing design system unchanged
4. Document all breaking changes
5. Create migration examples for each phase

### Key Principles
- **Preserve Design**: Keep the pastel color scheme and visual hierarchy
- **Maintain Simplicity**: Don't over-engineer solutions
- **Zero Dependencies**: Use native APIs where possible
- **Progressive Enhancement**: New features should enhance, not replace
- **Developer Friendly**: Clear documentation and examples

### Review
This modernization plan will bring the FileUI style guide up to current industry standards while maintaining its clean design and simple architecture. The phased approach ensures we can deliver value incrementally while maintaining stability.
