# Inline Styles Documentation

## HTML Cleanup Summary

We successfully reduced inline styles from 240+ to just 52. The remaining inline styles are documented below.

## Inline Styles That Should Remain

The following inline styles should remain as they represent:
1. Dynamic values that may change at runtime
2. One-off styles that don't warrant a utility class
3. Complex combinations that are used only once

### Progress Bars
- `style="background: var(--pastel-success); width: 42%; height: 100%;"` - Dynamic width percentage

### Color Swatches (Used in Color Palette Section)
- Various color swatches with specific pastel colors and sizes
- These are demonstration elements showing the color palette

### Specific Component Styles
- Progress bar containers
- Code blocks with specific heights
- Transform animations that may be dynamically controlled
- Absolute positioning for badges/indicators
- Border combinations for button groups

### Dynamic Values
- Width percentages for progress indicators
- Transform values for hover states
- Specific icon colors for status indicators

## Recommendations

1. **Keep these inline styles** as they represent:
   - Dynamic values (like progress bar width)
   - Demo/example elements (color swatches)
   - One-off positioning (absolute positioned elements)
   - Complex style combinations used only once

2. **Consider future refactoring** for:
   - Icon color utilities if pattern repeats
   - Transform utilities if used more frequently
   - Additional size utilities as needed

## Utility Classes Created

We added 200+ new utility classes including:
- Padding utilities (p-0 through p-8, px-, py-)
- Width/height utilities (w-full, h-200, etc.)
- Background colors (bg-gray-*, bg-pastel-*)
- Text colors (text-primary, text-pastel-*)
- Flex utilities (flex-1, items-center, justify-between)
- Animation utilities (animate-spin)
- Composite classes (panel-content, modal-content-box)

This approach maintains clean, maintainable code while preserving necessary flexibility for dynamic and demonstration elements.
